# CV in Physics
## Project
During my time as a senior in physics, I began to think about ways to implement Computer Vision in physics. As I was conducting a nobel prize winning experiment in my advanced physics lab, I found my first way to achieve this goal. Using naive software and outdated techniques, my partner Will Mingus and I theorized that you could train a deep-learning model to track and predict charge, rather than clicking on a still frame every once in a while. This thought led to this experiment where we utilize modern COmputer Vision tools such as optical flow, neural networks and transformers to achieve real-time predictions. This paper is currently in the works, and this page will be updated once finished.
