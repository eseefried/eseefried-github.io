## Overview
My second non-machine learning project, again expanding on a class project. Utilizing virtual reality (VR), I explored teaching people how to percieve colors as a sound, using colors that correspond to the visible color spectrum. This work is currently under review at IEEE VR, and this page will be expanded upon acceptance!

## Abstract
Virtual reality (VR) is a developing technology with the potential to enhance perceptual abilities in users. Individuals with visual deficiencies (such as color blindness, low vision, and others) do not perceive colors accurately in a VR environment. In this paper, we present an innovative technique that converts sound to color perception within a VR framework. This method maps seven fundamental colors from the visible color spectrum, to specific piano notes on the major scale, allowing color perception through sound. Implementation involves four phases: initial training, three specific tasks (organization, selection, and Stroop test), a VR chromesthesia experience, and a qualitative post-study survey. The results of the user study demonstrate encouraging kappa values of 0.73, and 0.52, for the selection task and Stroop test, respectively, reflecting successful learning and comprehension of the associations between colors and sounds. Importantly, the therapeutic chromesthesia experience in VR created an immersive and pleasant user experience in VR. This investigation paves new paths for using sound-based color perception to improve accessibility and therapeutic applications in VR environments.
