## Poster Presentation
HCII was my first experience at a human centered conference, and it was exciting to meet researchers with a different background than I traditionally work with. This conference took place in Washington D.C., and I was excited to share my work on a VR platform I built, designed for teaching people Spanish. In this work we found that participants enjoy learning in Virtual Reality, but with current technology, a "mixed" approach might be the best way to learn.
