## Poster Presentation
I had the opportunity to meet top researchers from around the world during my poster presentation at the Synthetic Data Workshop for Computer Vision at CVPR. I presented my work on Synthetic Data Generation, which sparked insightful conversations. Check out my project page for more details and access to my paper.

My poster focused on exploring the use of game and physics engines, and their impact on deep learning when generating synthetic data for amorphous objects. We showcased the differences in the quality of smoke generated in NVIDIA Omniverse versus Unreal Engine 5, as well as the quantity of synthetic data required when integrating it into a real-world training set. It was exciting to present these findings and discuss their implications with leading researchers!
