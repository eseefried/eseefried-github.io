ICMI which was held in Paris, France at Sorbonne University was my first conference. Along with my peers Jack Fitzgerald, and James Yost, I was able to go and present our paper titled: Paying Attention to Wildfire: Using U-Net with Attention Blocks
on Multimodal Data for Next Day Prediction. See the full details of this research at: [Preventing Wildfires](/research/wildfire)

# Banquet
After the conference, all atendees were invited to the historical portion of Sorbonne, which felt like it was straight out of Hogwarts. This event was a great way to wrap up a fantastic week in Paris, with all the other scholars I made friends with from around the world.
