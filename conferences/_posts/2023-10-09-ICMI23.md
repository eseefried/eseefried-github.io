ICMI which was held in Paris, France at Sorbonne University was my first conference. Along with my peers Jack Fitzgerald, and James Yost, I was able to go and present our paper titled: Paying Attention to Wildfire: Using U-Net with Attention Blocks
on Multimodal Data for Next Day Prediction. See more on this research at: [Preventing Wildfires(/_research/wildfire.md)].
